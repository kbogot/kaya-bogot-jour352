                        <p>
                            I shot photos in the field and at events, catering the photo style to fit with varying story types. I edited all content myself prior to publication and I collaborated with editors and reporters to cover breaking news stories.

                            I directed the production crew during the bi-weekly newscast, working notably close with the technical director to organize the show according to the rundown. I also worked with producers to finalize rundowns and adjust the show for any breaking news. In production I operated broadcast cameras, floor directed anchors and operated live graphics changes.

                        <p>
                            I reported stories about local campus entertainment and activities and the rise of artificial intelligence in education and researched sources in the academic administration and conducted interviews with experts in their fields.

                         <p>
                            I was a freelance anchor and reporter for the “Weekly Roundup” news broadcast and “Drop the Pop” entertainment news. I pitched, researched, wrote and reported local and national news for radio.
